# omxremote
omxremote is a mobile friendly webinterface to remote control omxplayer.bin on your raspberry pi. connect the pi to a tv/beamer, and use omxremote with your mobile phone to control video playback.

STATUS
Currently under development. I'd say it's in alpha phase.
What works:
 - a prototype of the UI
 - remote controlling omxplayer using python/dbus

TODO
 - glue all the parts together (implement flask backend)
 - refactor
 - create debian apt repository for raspbian
